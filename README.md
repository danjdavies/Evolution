# Evolution
Base Framework

I'm constantly copying and pasting HTML and CSS from other projects when I start something new, but not anymore. I'm finally going to sort my own base out. If other people use it, winner winner chicken dinner but it is essentially just my way of starting  afresh each time with something that works.

Plus it's a good way of trying out stuff innit :)

***** UPDATE *****

I've since got Gulp working with the project so if you do plan on using this, you'll need Gulp (probably).

This link http://www.sitepoint.com/introduction-gulp-js/ was invaluable for me setting it up. It's dead easy if you follow it.
